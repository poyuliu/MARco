Description: MARco is an R code and function set for microbiome analysis with less pain to generate basic plots of microbial ecology, including alpha diversity boxplots, violin plots, beta diversity ordination (PCoA based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity) with ADONIS test, and several statistical and visualization tools (see below). MARco also contains several discrete color sets for applying to your grouped plots. For advanced analysis, co-occurrence network analysis is also able to conduct by MARco.
